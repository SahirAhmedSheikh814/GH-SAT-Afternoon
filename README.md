# 📌 GIAIC-SAT Afternoon: Code & Summaries Repository

## 🏆 **An Initiative to Help Students**
This repository is dedicated to **all students** who are part of the **Saturday (2 - 5) slot** under the guidance of **Sir Muhammad Bilal and Sir Ali Aftab Sheikh**. 

I have been consistently posting **class summaries, code, and assignments** since **Quarter 2, Class 1**, and I will continue to do so for all upcoming classes. This initiative is meant to help:
- 🛑 **Students who missed a class** due to any reason.
- 🔄 **Students who attended but want to revise topics**.
- 🎯 **Anyone looking for structured learning materials** on the covered concepts.

Everything that happens in class is documented here. 🚀
